First of all: Thanks for your interest in this project and taking the time to contribute.

Reporting bugs
---------------

If you have found a bug, please check the project's `issue <https://github.com/rheinwerk-verlag/planning-poker/issues>`_
page first and feel free to create a `new issue <https://github.com/rheinwerk-verlag/planning-poker/issues/new>`_, if no
one else has reported it yet.

When reporting a bug, it is helpful to include additional information about the problem you have encountered:

* A traceback and/or screenshots of the issue
* The versions of the involved packages
* Ideally a code example which can be used to consistently reproduce the bug

Making changes
--------------

order to get a running system. It is also advisable to at least skim through the

Coding style
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have created an `EditorConfig <https://editorconfig.org/>`_ file for this project that should be usable for most
IDEs. Otherwise please make sure to adhere to the specifications from the config file.

Python
""""""

The code follows the `PEP8 style guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ with the exception that the maximum
line length is 120 characters. You can use ``flake8`` with the configuration from the ``tox.ini`` file to check if your
changes conform with the rest of this project's code.

JavaScript and Vue
""""""""""""""""""

Follow `Google's JS style guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html>`_ for the JavaScript code and
`Vue's style guide <https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/>`_ for the Vue specific code. The maximum line length was also
extended to 120 characters. There is currently no linting set up for these style guides.

you want to make.

Creating a pull request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before creating a pull request make sure to check whether:

* Docstrings
   * Existing docstrings have to be updated
   * New code has valid and descriptive docstrings
* Tests
   * Existing `tests <https://github.com/rheinwerk-verlag/planning-poker/tree/development/tests>`_ have to be fixed
   * New code is covered by tests
   * All tests pass
* The documentation (in particular the
  `Sphinx documentation <https://github.com/rheinwerk-verlag/planning-poker/tree/development/docs>`_) has to be modified
* You updated the translations if you added or changed translated strings ::

    $ cd planning_poker
    $ python ../manage.py makemessages

  or mentioned in the pull request that there are missing translations

* Any user-facing changes are documented in the changelog
* You added yourself to the list of authors

New features should be merged into the ``development`` branch, whereas smaller bugs can be directly merged into the
``main`` branch.
